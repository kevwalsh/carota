Our home is tucked away at the end of a long dead end road, it's a bit hard to find.

There are two quick options from the Toronto area, the choice route depends on where you're coming from, and traffic on the 401, 410, and 400.

* [Directions via Barrie](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACiKYzXHU1NFo7I8s5xCHCezHsHtyFOuEtA) â€¦ Usually the best option from uptown Toronto, the east end, the Junction.
* [Directions via Orangeville](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgOxijid59FPbb5_R1c2C6SK0Jf7p2U4no). The better option from downtown, or west end. Definitely the way to go if you're coming from the airport.

If you use your phone or gps for directions, each system seems to spell our address differently... "Third sideroad, 3rd Side Rd, 3 Side", etc.

* Google Maps: <https://goo.gl/maps/27qlY>, or type in ```547316 Side Road 3, Clarksburg ON```
* Don't use Apple Maps on an iPhone, it will put you in a ditch.
