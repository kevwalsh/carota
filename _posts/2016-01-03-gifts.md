Since we moved here a year ago, many of you have visited. Our house is full almost every other weekend and we love it, this has been the greatest gift! For most of you who live in Toronto, we've spent more time with most of you since we moved to the middle of nowhere. We've been sharing with you some amazing meals around our family table, skiing, hiking, mountain biking, lazy times on the porch and in the the living room, endless apple pressing, jam-making, mushroom hunting, sunny rock climbing, buggy gardening, pool splashing, kick sledding ...

We really hope this will go on and on for all our life here.

If you feel so inclined, you can contribute to our fund for building a cabin on our land.

It might not be winterized at first, and it might take us a couple of years to built, but wouldn't you love to come up and stay in our little cabin in the middle of the wildflowers field?

There will be a donation box set up at the party.

**But only if you promise to come stay in it!**
