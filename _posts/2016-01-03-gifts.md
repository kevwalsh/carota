If you really feel like, you can contribute to our fund for building a cabin on our land.

But only if you promise to come stay in it!

Since we moved here a year ago many of you came to visit. Our house is full pretty much every other week end and we love it! We made sure we moved somewhere where friends would like to come up and hang out. And it works! We've spend more time with most of you since we moved in the middle of nowhere. We've been sharing with you some amazing meals around our family table, fun skiing, hiking, MTB, endless apple pressing, hardcore jam making, sucesfull mushrooms hunting, sunny rock climbing, buggy gardening, pool splashing, kick sledding, hot tubbing...

We really hope this will go on and on for all our life here.

It might not be winterized at first, and it might take us a couple of years to built, but wouldn't you love to come up and stay in our little cabin in the middle of the wildflowers field?

There will be a donation box set up at the party.
