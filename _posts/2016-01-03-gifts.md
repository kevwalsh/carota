If you really feel like, you can contribute to our fund for building a cabin on our land.

But only if you promise to come stay in it.

Since we moved here a year ago many of you came to visit, our house is full pretty much every other week end and we love it! We made sure we moved somewhere where friends would like to come up and hang out. And it works! We've spend more time with most of you since we moved in the middle of nowhere. We've been sharing some amazing meals around our massive table, gone skiing, hiking, MTB, apple pressing, jam making, mushrooms hunting, rock climbing, gardening... 
We really hope this will go on for all our life here.
But despite of having a guest room, we really would like to offer you more space. It might not be winterized at first, and it might take us a couple of years to built, but won't it be awesome?!
