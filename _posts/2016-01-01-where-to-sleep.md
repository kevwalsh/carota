### Camping

We have tons of space for tents.  We'll have a simple outdoor kitchen set up and an outdoor toilet.

### Bed and Breakfasts

There are a lot of traditional B&B's and also a number of [Airbnb listings](https://www.airbnb.ca/s/duncan--on?checkin=29-07-2016&checkout=31-07-2016&guests=2&zoom=11&search_by_map=true&sw_lat=44.21212617906206&sw_lng=-80.63410933790158&ne_lat=44.514049781816155&ne_lng=-80.27018721876095&ss_id=ifmu1n5w&s_tag=bnalNWu4#).
