If you like using Google Maps for directions, <a href="https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fmaps%2F27qlY">use this link</a>, or type in "547316 Side Road 3, Clarksburg ON”. I’m not sure about other GPS devices, but don’t use Apple Maps on an iPhone, it will put you on an ATV trail.  Our real (Canada Post) address is 547316 3rd Side Road RR1, Ravenna ON, N0H 2E0.

If you're not using Google maps or GIS, use one of these... The fastest of which sometimes depends on traffic on the 401, 410, and 400.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/ACiKYzXHU1NFo7I8s5xCHCezHsHtyFOuEtA">Directions via Barrie</a> … usually the faster option from uptown Toronto, the east end, the Junction, and better on snow days.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgOxijid59FPbb5_R1c2C6SK0Jf7p2U4no">Directions via Orangeville</a> … usually the better option from downtown, or west end.</li>
</ul>
