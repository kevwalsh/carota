Our home is tucked away at the end of a long dead end road, it's a bit hard to find.

### Printable

There are two options from the Toronto area, the fastest depends on traffic on the 401, 410, and 400.

* [Directions via Barrie](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACiKYzXHU1NFo7I8s5xCHCezHsHtyFOuEtA) â€¦ Usually the best option from uptown Toronto, the east end, the Junction.
* [Directions via Orangeville](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACgOxijid59FPbb5_R1c2C6SK0Jf7p2U4no). The better option from downtown, or west end. Definitely the way to go if you're coming from the airport.


### GPS

Every GPS system seems to spell our address differently... "Third sideroad, 3rd Side Rd, 3 Side", etc.

* Google Maps: <https://goo.gl/maps/27qlY>, or type in ```547316 Side Road 3, Clarksburg ON```
* Don't use Apple Maps on an iPhone, it will put you in a ditch.
