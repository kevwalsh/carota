#### Bring

* Your guitar, your voice, your bocce game, your frizbee, or anything you'd like to share
* Shoes & clothes: We would love it super casual (or exentrique!), but leave those heels and tight suits at home
* Scarf, Long sleeves or pants to protect yourself from the mosquitos at sunset!
* Your sexy speedo (French joke) or any swimsuit and towel for the pool
* Your bike, hiking shoes, sunscreen 
* [Your kids!](/kids)


#### If you're Camping

* Food: Depending on how many of you are camping we might structure a bit some meals to make them feel seamless 
* Tent, sleeping & cooking stuff
* You won't have access to the house but there'll be an outdoor shower, kitchen, toilets set up
