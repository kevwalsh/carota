#### Bring

* Your guitar, your voice, your p√©tanque/bocce game, your frisbee, and anything you'd like to share.
* Shoes & clothes: We would love it super casual (or exentrique!), but leave those heels and tight suits at home please.
* Scarf, long sleeves or pants to protect yourself from the mosquitoes at sunset!  The bugs are only out for an hour so, but after that the temperature can drop a lot more than in the city.
* Your sexy speedo (French joke) or any swimsuit and towels for the pool.
* Sunscreen and maybe mosquito repellent.
* [Your kids!](/kids)

#### If you're camping

* See above, and:
* Tent & sleeping bag & camping mattress.
* Headlamp or flashlight.
* BYOB for Sunday/Monday. 
* Your bike?
* Hiking shoes?
* You won't have access to the house but there'll be an outdoor shower, kitchen, toilets set up.
* Check back in here as the date approaches, we'll have more details!
