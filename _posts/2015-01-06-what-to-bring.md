#### Bring

* Your guitar, your voice, your bocce game, your frizbee, and anything you'd like to share
* Shoes & clothes: We would love it super casual (or exentrique!), but leave those heels and tight suits at home please
* Scarf, Long sleeves or pants to protect yourself from the mosquitos at sunset!
* Your sexy speedo (French joke) or any swimsuit and towel for the pool
* Your bike, hiking shoes, sunscreen
* [Your kids!](/kids)


#### If you're camping

* Food: Expect to bring your own (and coolers and ice etc). We might structure a bit some meals and need some volunteers if many of you are camping.  
* Tent, sleeping & cooking stuff
* You won't have access to the house but there'll be an outdoor shower, kitchen, toilets set up
* we'll have plenty of ice on hand to keep drinks cold. 
* check back in here as the date approaches, we'll have more details!
