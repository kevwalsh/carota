#### Camping

We have lots of space for tents at home if you're cool with using an outhouse, outdoor shower & cooking!
Yup you wonâ€™t have access to the house cause you will be too many...

If you're coming from far away: arrive anytime and stay as long as you want.

If you're coming from Toronto (and have a chance to come visit when it's less busy): arrive Saturday and stay for a night or two.  

Check out the list of [stuff to bring](/what-to-bring).

#### Airbnb, B&B's & hotels

We are 5 minutes south of Duncan, 20 minutes south of Thornbury (beaches, groceries, restaurants and bars), 25 minutes from the base of Blue Mountain, and 30 minutes from downtown Collingwood.

- **Airbnbs**: There are [many options around us](https://www.airbnb.ca/s/Duncan--Canada?checkin=29-07-2016&checkout=01-08-2016&guests=2&room_types%5B%5D=Entire+home%2Fapt&sw_lat=44.26659464166998&sw_lng=-80.60931852550351&ne_lat=44.52074649763&ne_lng=-80.28659513683164&search_by_map=true&zoom=11&ss_id=2ulkhhr6&s_tag=oH5o_ORV). A couple of the airbnbs would work with larger groups if you want to share.

- **B&Bs**: Most B&Bs in the area are also listed on airbnb , but [here's one that's $150/night, in Heathcote](http://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/heathcote-haven-bed-amp-breakfast.en-gb.html?label=gen173rf-1FCAsoJ0IhaGVhdGhjb3RlLWhhdmVuLWJlZC1hbXAtYnJlYWtmYXN0SA1YA2gniAEBmAENuAEPyAEM2AEB6AEB-AEEogIOMTI3LjAuMC4xOjQwMDCoAgM;sid=39da0f7d6b99eb58831db5cd9252614a;dcid=12;dist=0;group_adults=2;sb_price_type=total;type=total&;lang=en-gb), that isn't.

- **Hotels**: [Here's a link to some hotels.](https://www.ca.kayak.com/hotels/The-Blue-Mountains,ON,Canada-c58574/2016-07-29/2016-08-01/2guests), most of which are at the base of Blue Mountain or in Collingwood.
