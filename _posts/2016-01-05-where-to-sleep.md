#### Camping

You can set up anytime Saturday morning, but please only show up from 1:30 cause we have a lot to do!

* Do not leave food in your tents...There's a lot of wildlife around.
* There will be an outdoor fridge accessible from Sunday only
* If you need electricity, there are some outdoor plug on the house's wall by the pool
* There will be some porta-potties, outdoor shower & cooking.
* Yup you won’t have access to the house cause there will be too many of you!
* Don't forget your headlamps!
