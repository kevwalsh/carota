#### Camping

You can set up anytime Saturday morning on any of the campsites in the field (There'll be signs!, but please only show up at the house from 1:30 cause we have a lot to do!

* Do not leave food in your tents...There's a lot of wildlife around.
* There will be an outdoor fridge accessible from Sunday only
* If you need electricity, there are some outdoor plug on the house's wall by the pool
* There will be some porta-potties and outdoor shower.
* Yup you wonâ€™t have access to the house cause there will be too many of you!
* Don't forget your headlamps!
