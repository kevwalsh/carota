#### Camping

We have lots of space for tents at home if you're cool with using an outhouse, outdoor shower & cooking!
Yup you wonâ€™t have access to the house cause you will be too many...

If you're coming from far away: arrive anytime and stay as long as you want.

If you're coming from Toronto (and have a chance to come visit when it's less busy): arrive Saturday and stay for a night or two.

#### Airbnb, B&B's & hotels

We are 5 minutes south of the village of Duncan (no retail there, just a reference for maps!), 20 minutes south of Thornbury (Beaches, groceries, restaurants and bars), 25 minutes from Collingwood, 25 from Blue Mountain ski resort.

- **Airbnbs**: [Many options around us](https://www.airbnb.ca/s/Duncan--Canada?checkin=29-07-2016&checkout=01-08-2016&guests=2&room_types%5B%5D=Entire+home%2Fapt&sw_lat=44.26659464166998&sw_lng=-80.60931852550351&ne_lat=44.52074649763&ne_lng=-80.28659513683164&search_by_map=true&zoom=11&ss_id=2ulkhhr6&s_tag=oH5o_ORV), including lots of condos at Blue Mountain. The other options seem nicer to us (because in a less touristy spot) but are way fewer so it's probably best not to wait too long.  A couple of the airbnbs would work with larger groups if you want to share.

- **B&Bs**: [In Heathcote 150cad/night](http://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/heathcote-haven-bed-amp-breakfast.fr.html?aid=309654%3Blabel%3Dbooking-be-en-us-3SqKhEWLtwZZHncJh*yhgQS63640052092%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2812%2C000%3Aac%3Aap1t1%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atikwd-2558630230%3Alp1002393%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm%3Bsid%3Db6e2c9e88874d8f6fd93d291ec1f2c10%3Bdcid%3D4%3Bcheckin%3D2016-07-29%3Bcheckout%3D2016-08-01%3Bdist%3D0%3Bgroup_adults%3D2%3Broom1%3DA%2CA%3Bsb_price_type%3Dtotal%3Bspdest%3Dci%2F-574760%3Bspdist%3D5.5%3Bsrfid%3D8c7383e82f041c7fbba51cf2e4d96b0caaae534bX1%3Btype%3Dtotal%3Bucfs%3D1)

- **Hotels**: [Here's a link to some hotels.](https://www.ca.kayak.com/hotels/The-Blue-Mountains,ON,Canada-c58574/2016-07-29/2016-08-01/2guests), most of which are at the base of Blue Mountain or in Collingwood.
