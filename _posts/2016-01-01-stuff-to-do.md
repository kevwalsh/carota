#### A map

#### Swimming

There's a pond 500m east of our house.  It's spring fed, so yes it's cold.

There's a little pool at our home.  Bring your suit to the party. :)

The beautiful Beaver Rivers flows nearby, and there are a couple of great swimming holes 15-20 minutes from our house.  One is near Kimberley, and the other in Slabtown.  Both have moving water.

And of course Georgian Bay is 20 minutes away, with its big sandy beaches and some stretches of limestone shore.  We recommend Craigleith.

#### Hiking


#### Biking


For mountain bikers, the Kolapore trails system can be accessed from the end of our driveway, or from a parking lot on Gray Road 2, south of the intersection with 19.

#### Rock climbing
