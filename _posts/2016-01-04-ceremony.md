We do like the way Quakers get married so we've decided to include some of their traditions into our ceremony even though we are NOT Quakers. The main appeal for us is that all of you will be involved in the ceremony, which is what we deeply wanted.

At the beginning of the ceremony, we will stand and exchange vows. Then anyone can participate. There will be periods of silence to allow all of us some time for reflection.

If you would like to speak, you just have to stand up as the last person finishes. Any form of message is welcome and can be literal or metaphorical, and about anything appropriate to the joy and solemnity of the occasion. You might feel like reading letters or literature, sharing a song, artwork, or maybe just say a few words.

If you are unsure, you can always ask us. You can also just be in the moment with all of us without saying a word, there's no pressure at all to stand up. Actually...since there will be a lot of us it would take for ever!

in any case we're asking you to keep it short so we can fit everybody who wants to stand up.
