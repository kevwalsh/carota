We're not Quakers, but we like their approach to a wedding ceremony:
At the beginning of the ceremony, we will stand and exchange vows. Then anyone can participate. There will be periods of silence to allow all of us some time for reflection.

If you would like to speak, you just have to stand up as the last person finishes. Any form of message is welcome and can be literal or metaphorical, with anything appropriate to the occasion. You might feel like saying a few words, reading a poem, sharing a song, artwork ... follow your inspiration!

You can also just be in the moment with all of us without saying a word.

If you are unsure, you can always ask us.
