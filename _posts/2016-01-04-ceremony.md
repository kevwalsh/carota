We wanted something intimate, simple, with the feeling of sharing this very special moment with you all.
We've decided to include some of the Quakers traditions into our ceremony, because we do like the way they get married.
The main appeal for us is that all of you will be involved in the ceremony, which is what we deeply wanted.

At the beginning of the ceremony, we will stand and exchange vows. Then anyone can participate. There will be periods of silence to allow all of us some time for reflection.

If you would like to speak, you just have to stand up as the last person finishes. Any form of message is welcome and can be literal or metaphorical, and about anything appropriate to the occasion. You might feel like saying a few words, reading a poem, sharing a song, artwork....follow your inspiration!

You can also just be in the moment with all of us without saying a word.

If you are unsure, you can always ask us.

In any case we're asking you to keep it short so we can fit everybody who wants to stand up.
