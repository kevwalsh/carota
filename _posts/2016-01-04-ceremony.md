*STILL NEEDS EDITING*

First of all, we are not Quakers.  But we do like the way Quakers get married so we've decided to include some of their traditions into our ceremony.

At the beginning of the ceremony, Lisa and Kevin will stand and exchange vows. After this, anyone may stand and speak if so moved. While messages are welcome, periods of silence are expected and are a time for reflection.

If you would like to speak, please stand as the last person finishes. Messages may be literal or metaphorical, and about anything appropriate to the joy and solemnity of the occasionâ€”love, family, marriage, life, or what you will.

Since there are lots of people invited, we are going to ask that you keep any message brief (please don't make us give you the "that's enough" signal from the alter).  But any form of a message is welcome. We've heard of people reading letters or literature aloud, sharing a song, artwork, etc.  If words aren't your thing, find another way.  Pretty much anything is good.  (If you are unsure, you can always ask us.  =)
