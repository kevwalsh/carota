#### Saturday July 30

**Morning** If you're camping: arrive whenever, set up your tent, and go for a hike/bike/swim/whatever.  Or help set up with us :)

-----

**2pm** Welcome!  Refreshments!

**2:30pm** [The wedding ceremony](/ceremony).  

**3ish** Swimming, hangouts, games for the kids.

**5ish** An earlyish dinner.

**7ish** An awesome band.

**8:51pm** Sunset!

Then bonfires, beers, and hopefully an appearance by our good friend, the Milky Way.

#### Sunday (and Monday)

For those sticking around:

We'd love to go for bike ride with you, or if it's really hot, all head to a swimming hole or the beach.  Or both.  

These plans will evolve, check back here later.
