We're expecting 24kids!

* There will be a magician show at 4pm
* The pool will be closed for the ceremony and for dinner. We don't have any extra water wings or life jackets, you may want to bring
* There will be a baby sitter in the house for LÃ©a once she goes to bed around 9pm. You're welcome put your kids to sleep in the living room and she can come get you if there're awake
* There's a live band playing, you might want to bring ear protections for the kids
