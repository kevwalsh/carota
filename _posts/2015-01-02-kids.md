We're expecting about two dozen kids under 10 years old.

* A company will come to do fun activities with them(3+) for a couple of hours. When you RSVP, let us know who's coming so we can plan this!
* Our pool will be fenced but we'll ask parents to take turns to make sure little swimmers are constantly being watched.
* If you prefer a baby sitter, we might be able to find somebody local for you. Just ask as early as you can.
