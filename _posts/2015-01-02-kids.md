We're expecing a dozen or two kids under 10 years old.

* A company will come to do fun activities with the kids (3+) for a couple of hours. When you RSVP, let us know who's coming so we can plan this a bit!
* Our pool will be fenced but we'll ask parents to take turns to make sure little swimmers are constantly being watched.
* If you prefer a baby sitter, we might be able to find somebody local for you.
