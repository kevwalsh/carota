We're expecting a dozen or two kids under 10 years old.

* We're hiring someone to facilitate games and activities for kids for a couple of hours after the ceremony. When you RSVP, please let us know who's coming so we can plan this a bit!
* Our pool is fenced but we'll ask parents to take turns to make sure little swimmers are constantly being watched.
* If you prefer a baby sitter, we might be able to find somebody local for you.
