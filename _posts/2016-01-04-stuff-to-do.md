Stick around for a day or two!

#### Swimming

There's a little pool at our home.  Bring your suit! (And towel.)

The beautiful Beaver River flows nearby, and there are a couple of great swimming holes 15-20 minutes from our house. One is near Kimberley, and the other in Slabtown.  Both these spots having moving water, so not great for little kids.

Georgian Bay is 20 minutes away, with its big sandy beaches and some stretches of limestone shore.  We recommend Craigleith and the YMCA beach of Wasaga Beach.  The closest beach, in Thornbury, is great for little kids.

#### Hiking

The [Bruce Trail](http://brucetrail.org/) is a 5 minute drive from our place. But it winds all over the area, with great hikes including Old Baldy, with a view over the Beaver Valley, the Loree Forest with views over Georgian Bay, and a half dozen great waterfalls at the top of the Beaver Valley, near Eugenia.

The Kolapore trails are just around the corner, and in late July the wild mushrooms will be plentiful.  Oyster mushrooms, comb's tooth, pear-shaped puffballs, and more.

#### Biking

For mountain bikers, the Kolapore trails system can be accessed from the end of our driveway, or from a parking lot on Grey Road 2, south of the intersection with 19. There's also 3-stage nearby, and Blue Mountain.

Road bikers will find many beautiful hills to climb nearby, either on quiet gravel roads or buttery smooth paved roads, many with decent shoulders.

#### Rock climbing

Three best areas in the county are around us: Metcalfe Rock (5 minute drive and 5 minute hike), The Swamp (a bit more of a hike), and Old Baldy in Kimberley.

#### Treetop canopy walk and ziplining

[Scenic Caves](http://www.sceniccaves.com/activities/eco-adventure-tours/) has fun activities for families and some amazing views on Georgian Bay.

#### Canoeing the Beaver River, caving, Stand up paddling, Kayaking on the bay

[Free Spirit](http://www.freespirit-tours.com/paddling/) is a local company who has a bunch of fun activities including canoeing down the Beaver, sea kayaking, caving, SUP.
