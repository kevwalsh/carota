## Camping

We have lots of space for tents at home if you're cool with using an outhouse, outdoor shower & cooking!

Yup you wonâ€™t have access to the house cause you will be too many...

If you're coming from far away: arrive anytime and stay as long as you want.

If you're coming from Toronto (and have a chance to come visit when it's less busy!): arrive Saturday and stay for a night or two!
